Docker is a platform that enables developers to create, deploy, and run applications in containers. This ensures consistency across different environments.



## Key Benefits

- **Isolation**: Run your TypeScript application in a dedicated environment.
- **Portability**: Easily share and deploy your app on any system with Docker installed.
- **Efficiency**: Quickly set up your development environment without conflicts.










Hereâ€™s a simple example of a Dockerfile for a TypeScript application:

dockerfile: 

# Use Node.js as the base image
FROM node:16

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and install dependencies
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Build the TypeScript code
RUN npm run build

# Expose the application port
EXPOSE 3000

# Run the application
CMD ["npm", "start"]
